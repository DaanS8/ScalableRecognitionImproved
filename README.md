# Scalable Recognition Improved
A python implementation for a scalable object detection framework. This is an improved version of the Scalable Recognition repository that was based on the paper Scalable Recognition with a Vocabulary Tree. This improvement of this version is due to the use of a more efficient data structure using the faiss library.
